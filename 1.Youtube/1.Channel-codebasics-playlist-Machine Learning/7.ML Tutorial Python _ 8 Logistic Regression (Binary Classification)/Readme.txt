Here we are understanding Classification machine learning model.
In this type of machine learning model we want to find out in 'Yes' or 'No' or in catigorical value.

There are two type of Classification machine learning model:
1) Binary Classification - Where expected answer is in Yes or No. 
	Example: Wether a person will buy a insurance or not? here the prediction answer comes in Yes/No
2) Multiclass Classification - Where expected answer in more than two classification.
	Example: Lets say there are three political parties Party A, Party B and Party C.
		We can predict to which party a person is likely to vote.
		If we are doing some kind of classification problem then we are using Multiclass Classification machine learning model

In this module we are learning about Binary Classification
